    <span style="font-size:200%">I love to learn, and one of my current goals,
  is to try and rewire my brain to make learning
  the fun part, to really enjoy  learning, so
  that way, I can become a life long learner,
  and hopefully sucess will come as a
  byproduct of loving to learn. Definitly not an
  easy thing though. ;(
